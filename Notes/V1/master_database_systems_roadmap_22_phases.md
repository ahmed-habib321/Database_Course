## 🎓 Final Outcome

By completing all **22 phases**, a learner can:
- Design correct and scalable schemas
- Optimize and debug slow queries
- Understand DB internals (storage, indexing, recovery)
- Build secure, transactional systems
- Scale databases across machines and regions
- Work with NoSQL, cloud, lakehouse, and modern data platforms

➡️ This roadmap aligns with **CS-grade DBMS theory**, **enterprise databases**, and **modern cloud data engineering**.
